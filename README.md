Micro C# Compiler

An attempt to build a small useful C# compiler in F# in under 7 years.

Goals:
The aim is not to build a C# compiler. Or even my favourite bits of the C# language. The goal is to make something fun, that could be used for lightweight tasks where csc.exe or Roslyn just donâ€™t make sense.
